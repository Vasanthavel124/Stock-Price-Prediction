## Problem Definition

The problem at hand is to build a predictive model that forecasts stock prices based on historical market data. The goal is to create a tool that assists investors in making well-informed decisions and optimizing their investment strategies. This project involves various steps including data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Design Thinking

### Data Collection

To start with, we need to collect historical stock market data. The dataset should include essential features like date, open price, close price, volume, and other relevant indicators. We will use this data to train and evaluate our predictive models.

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is crucial for ensuring the quality and consistency of the data. In this step, we will:
- Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers.
- Convert categorical features into numerical representations, possibly using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Scale or normalize numerical features as needed to bring them to a common scale.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering aims to create additional features that could enhance the predictive power of our model. This may involve:
- Calculating moving averages of stock prices over different time periods.
- Incorporating technical indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands.
- Creating lagged variables to capture temporal dependencies in the data.

### Model Selection

Selecting the right algorithm for time series forecasting is critical. We will consider algorithms such as:
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for their simplicity and effectiveness.
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for their ability to capture complex temporal patterns.

### Model Training

Once we've chosen the appropriate model, we will train it using the preprocessed data. This involves splitting the data into training and validation sets, and potentially using techniques like cross-validation for model tuning.

### Evaluation

Evaluating the model's performance is essential to assess its predictive accuracy. We will use appropriate time series forecasting metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure the average prediction error.
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to account for the magnitude of errors.
- Other relevant metrics to gauge the model's reliability.
